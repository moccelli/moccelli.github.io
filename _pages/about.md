I was born in Turin on October, 5th, 1991. I received the Bachelor Degree in International Trade from the University of Turin (Italy) in 2013, advised by Prof. Eleonora Isaia. I defended a thesis about new sources of financial intermediation and micro-credits alternatives, entitled "Foresting South - South Investments: empirical study between South Africa and Afghanistan in the Telecommunication business".

Afterwards, I joined a Double Degree Program at University of Pavia, spending the second year of my Master at the University of Hohenheim (Germany). In December 2015, I received (cum laude) my M.Sc. Degree in Economics from both universities, defending a thesis on dual sectoral development model, advices by Prof. Harald Hagemann and by Prof. Giovanni Vaggi. My work analyzed the Eritrean Manzanar Project in view of the Lewis Model, investigating the increase in productivity in the subsistence sector to prevent internal migration.

Right after my Master Degree, I started working as responsible of the innovation department at Cleopa GmbH, a start-up company located in Berlin, focused on developing and offering energy efficiency solutions. In October 2016 I was admitted as a PhD Student at Santâ€™Anna School of Advanced Studies, in Pisa (Italy).
