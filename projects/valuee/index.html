    <h2 id="project-idea">Project Idea</h2>
<p>The aim of the project is to address the energy poverty issue. Energy poverty, is a widespread reality across Europe that occurs when a household is unable to afford the most basic levels of energy for adequate heating and lighting as well as common activities, such as cooking and the use of appliance at home. According to the European Commission, 11% of the European population currently suffers from fuel poverty and is unable to afford proper indoor thermal comfort. This condition is due to raising of energy prices, recessionary impacts on national and regional economies and poor energy efficient homes. If we use as proxy for determining energy poverty, the ability to keep the homes warm enough, late payment of the bills and presence of poor housing conditions, it is possible to see that especially Central – Eastern and Southern European countries are affected by this issue. The problem relies in two distinctive matters: vulnerable consumers and energy poverty; therefore, the challenge is dual: additional consumer protection (access to the market of vulnerable consumers) and energy affordability concerns. The most vulnerable consumer groups are those “at risk of poverty”, households with an income of 60% of the median national income. VALUEE project will address a specific target of low income consumer in order to help to make the jump towards becoming prosumers. <b>VALUEE target groups are: elderly, lone parents with dependent children, disable persons and immigrants. Moreover, the project targets students as well, which are not vulnerable in sense of income but in sense of knowledge and habit adoption.</b>
The project will reach the target objective of energy poverty reduction thanks to intervention on everyday life energy behaviour and choices.
As underlined by the London School of Economics Booklet (2008), <b>social housing</b> serves mainly single-parent families, elderly, immigrants and poor. The project will therefore intervene in this kind of environment: many buildings fall into the lowest energy efficiency categories and by implementing simple and cheap measures substantial long term savings can be achieved. Interventions to provide long-term solutions to fuel poverty require an integrated set of solutions as: improve building structure, financial tool accessible to weakest groups, refurbishment of existing dwellings, provide assistance for energy saving, change behaviour patterns, maximising incomes by ensuring they access any welfare programmes provided by countries. Students will be reached by direct access to <b>campus facilities</b> and through the intervention of universities.
VALUEE project aims to change the target population ́s behaviour patterns to reduce energy cost and improve thermal comfort; enhancing households with cost effective energy solutions, and promote indoor comfort by quality refurbishment programmes.</p>

<h3 id="project-outputs">Project Outputs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Creation of new working positions called “energy scanners”, low educated and long-term unemployed people trained to undertake an energy screening of the energy situation of a household, in which the household receive energy saving tips and energy saving devices (such as light bulb, smart meter);</li>
  <li>Guideline for addressing fuel poverty definition and specific evaluation of energy poverty issue in all the consortium countries, gathering information about energy requirements, local, national, EU policies, type of energy devices used in social housing, energy infrastructure present, and indoor climate level;</li>
  <li>Strategic Plan proposing tailored solution to policy-makers on the base of the precedent guidelines. Energy scanners contribution as well as a deatiled scheme of affordable incentives (direct and indirect) will be here specified. Affordable existing ICT-based solution will be here also included (ex. Smart metering);</li>
  <li>Pilot action in three selected areas (1. Eest Europe + 1 South Europe + 1 extra), consisting in the implementation of the strategic plan in a real case scenario and monitoring outcomes in terms of energy consumption reduction, energy condition improvements and CO2 reduction after 12 months project.</li>
